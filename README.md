> **Note**: Complete the [React Native Environment Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) guide for your platform.

## Firebase Setup

This project uses Firebase for authentication and Realtime Database. You'll need to set up your own Firebase project:

### 1. Create Firebase Project
1. Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
2. Create a new project
3. Enable **Authentication** > **Email/Password** sign-in method
4. Enable **Realtime Database** in test mode

### 2. Configure Android App
1. Add an Android app to your Firebase project
2. Package name: `com.safedrive`
3. Download `google-services.json`
4. Place it in `android/app/google-services.json`

### 3. Configure iOS App (Optional)
1. Add an iOS app to your Firebase project
2. Bundle ID: `com.safedrive`
3. Download `GoogleService-Info.plist`
4. Place it in `ios/SAFEDRIVE/GoogleService-Info.plist`

## Installation & Setup

### 1. Clone Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/hashim-i222478/SafeDrive.git
cd SAFEDRIVE
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
```bash
# Install Node.js dependencies
pnpm install

# Install iOS dependencies (macOS only)
cd ios && bundle install && bundle exec pod install && cd ..
```

### 3. Firebase Configuration
- Replace `android/app/google-services.json` with your Firebase config
- Replace `ios/SAFEDRIVE/GoogleService-Info.plist` with your Firebase config (iOS)

### 4. Start Metro Server
```bash
pnpm start
```

### 5. Run the App

#### Android
```bash
# Using pnpm
pnpm run android

# OR using React Native CLI
npx react-native run-android
```

#### iOS (macOS only)
```bash
# Using pnpm
pnpm run ios

# OR using React Native CLI
npx react-native run-ios
```

## Features

- üîê **Firebase Authentication** (Email/Password)
- üì± **Custom Navigation System**
- üé® **Custom UI Components**
- üíæ **Realtime Database Integration**
- üöó **Drowsiness Detection** (Coming Soon)

## Scripts

```bash
# Start Metro server
pnpm start

# Run on Android
pnpm run android

# Run on iOS
pnpm run ios

# Run tests
pnpm test

# Type checking
pnpm run tsc

# Linting
pnpm run lint
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. Metro Server Issues
```bash
# Clear Metro cache
npx react-native start --reset-cache
```

#### 2. Android Build Issues
```bash
# Clean Android build
cd android && ./gradlew clean && cd ..
npx react-native run-android
```

#### 3. iOS Build Issues (macOS)
```bash
# Clean iOS build
cd ios && xcodebuild clean && cd ..
npx react-native run-ios
```

#### 4. Firebase Authentication Issues
- Ensure `google-services.json` is in `android/app/`
- Verify Firebase project has Email/Password auth enabled
- Check internet connectivity

#### 5. Database Permission Errors
- Ensure Realtime Database is in **test mode**
- Rules should allow read/write for testing:
```json
{
  "rules": {
    ".read": true,
    ".write": true
  }
}
```

## Development

### Adding New Features
1. Create feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/new-feature`
2. Make changes and test
3. Commit: `git commit -m "Add new feature"`
4. Push: `git push origin feature/new-feature`
5. Create Pull Request

### Firebase Security Rules (Production)
For production, update Realtime Database rules:
```json
{
  "rules": {
    "users": {
      "$uid": {
        ".read": "$uid === auth.uid",
        ".write": "$uid === auth.uid"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Step 1: Start Metro

First, you will need to run **Metro**, the JavaScript build tool for React Native.

To start the Metro dev server, run the following command from the root of your React Native project:

```sh
# Using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```

## Step 2: Build and run your app

With Metro running, open a new terminal window/pane from the root of your React Native project, and use one of the following commands to build and run your Android or iOS app:

### Android

```sh
# Using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

### iOS

For iOS, remember to install CocoaPods dependencies (this only needs to be run on first clone or after updating native deps).

The first time you create a new project, run the Ruby bundler to install CocoaPods itself:

```sh
bundle install
```

Then, and every time you update your native dependencies, run:

```sh
bundle exec pod install
```

For more information, please visit [CocoaPods Getting Started guide](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html).

```sh
# Using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

If everything is set up correctly, you should see your new app running in the Android Emulator, iOS Simulator, or your connected device.

This is one way to run your app ‚Äî you can also build it directly from Android Studio or Xcode.

## Step 3: Modify your app

Now that you have successfully run the app, let's make changes!

Open `App.tsx` in your text editor of choice and make some changes. When you save, your app will automatically update and reflect these changes ‚Äî¬†this is powered by [Fast Refresh](https://reactnative.dev/docs/fast-refresh).

When you want to forcefully reload, for example to reset the state of your app, you can perform a full reload:

- **Android**: Press the <kbd>R</kbd> key twice or select **"Reload"** from the **Dev Menu**, accessed via <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (Windows/Linux) or <kbd>Cmd ‚åò</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (macOS).
- **iOS**: Press <kbd>R</kbd> in iOS Simulator.

## Congratulations! :tada:

You've successfully run and modified your React Native App. :partying_face:
